# DoanNicerShop
Assignment 2

This assignment is a shop where it has a recycler view to display the items to be purchased in which you can add and substract the quantity. It is supposed to be an upgraded version from the DoanShop.

I have taken inspiration from a couple of codelabs
I have also used stackoverflow to find and help with mistakes I have gotten.

I have come into problem with time management and was not able to complete this assignment on due time or to put the amount of work I wanted to because of a dilemma that happened at work.
